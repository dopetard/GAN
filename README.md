# GAN
This is my attempt to reproduce results from Ian Goodfellow et al classic [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) paper in Tensorflow


### Requirements

-[Tensorflow 1.2] (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/)



### Training on GTX-980 for about an hour or so

### The noisy random sample

### After training

<img src = "https://github.com/leakyrelu/GAN/blob/master/GAN%20output/sample499.jpg"/> <br/>

### Todo:

Update the output repo again, failed to upload many .png files
